Create a folder named lastname_firstname_chapterX where X is the chapter number of this assignment.
Inside that folder you will place the entire project folder for each programming challenge.  When 
creating the projects, use the naming scheme of lastname_firstname_YYY, where YYY are your initials.  
This should be done for both the project and the class that are created.  In addition to the code 
that you will be handing in, also create a requirements document and an event planning document for 
each challenge.  Place these documents in the corresponding project folder.  The naming scheme for 
the requirements document and event planner will be lastname_RD and lastname_EP respectively.  As 
always, proper programming practices should be utilized at all times, including thorough comments 
and variable naming schemes.  Once all items have been completed, zip the main folder and upload 
into the dropbox.
